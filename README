Set::Toolkit

Version 0.13

The Set Toolkit intends to provide a broad, robust interface to sets of
data.  Largely inspired by Set::Object, a default set from the Set Toolkit
should behave similarly enough to those created by Set::Object that 
interchanging between the two is fairly easy and intuitive.

In addition to the set functionality already available around the CPAN,
the Set Toolkit provides the ability to perform fairly complex, chained
searches against the set, ordered and unordered considerations, as well
as the ability to enforce or relax a uniqueness constraint (enforced by
default).  Sets can be taken in various contexts, including string, boolean,
and array(ref).

INSTALLATION

Install it like a normal cpan module: 

	cpan Set::Toolkit
