        I marked this a semi-major change (v0.03 => v0.10) because of the
        amount of added functionality.  It's like a major minor release =)

        Enhancements:
          * overloaded @{} so sets can be interpreted as array refs.
            * full array support for splice, push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.
            * decided that using the set as an array forces is_ordered to
              true (because an unordered array is just a set =)
          * overloaded "" so sets can be interpreted as strings.
          * overloaded bool so sets can be interpreted in boolean context.
          * added methods: first, last
          * generally optimized some of the searching and reporting for speed.
          * added test cases for the new functionality (I think there are some
            gaps, but I'm sure I'll come across them and fix them eventually.

        Bug Fixes:
          * ->size was ignoring is_unique, it's not now.
          * ->elements was not always taking is_unique into account properly.
          * fixed an issue that caused test cases not to get uploaded to 
            cpan properly!
          * fixed some issues that caused some tests to provide false
            positives on broken code.

        * Still trying to figure out how to upload to CPAN =)

0.02    2010-04-16 17:30:00
        * Changed the files and dirs so they aren't world-writable (so I can
          upload to CPAN).

0.01    2010-04-16 17:00:00
        * Basic construction
        * Mixed data-type sets.
        * Support for fairly complex querying of sets through "search" and
          "find".
        * The ability to view sets as ordered or unordered.
        * The ability to view sets as unique or duplicable.
